# One-Degree-Worth-of-Papers
This is a collection of the papers I have found and sometimes used while earning a PhD in computer science. All PDFs stored here were found in a publically available form, usually through Google Scholar. I will be adding BibTex citations for every paper here as time allows.

Please be aware that the nature of these papers is heavily skewed by my own research focus, so this shouldn't be seen as a generally representative collections.
